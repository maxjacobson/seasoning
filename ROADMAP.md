# Roadmap

Some things I'm planning to work on:

1. Pagination on [the reviews page](/reviews)
1. Like button on reviews
1. Comments on reviews
1. Possible to edit reviews after publishing them -- body, star rating, visibility
1. Sort following and followers pages by when it happened
1. Display air dates for shows and seasons
1. Can display your favorite shows on your page (like Letterboxd)
1. Lists of shows
1. Lists of seasons
1. Show the "note to self" on the homepage
1. Page that shows you what episodes are available from your currently watching shows
1. RSS feed for public reviews
1. An activity feed for the people you follow
1. A way to indicate that you're rewatching a show/season, not watching it for the first time
1. Some kind of notification when new episodes are available to watch
1. Some way to mark seasons as "skipped" -- for example if you add the bachelor because you want to watch the latest episode of the bachelor but you don't want to watch all 27 seasons, just the new one
1. Some way to mark episodes as "skipped" -- for example if you start watching saturday night live mid-season and don't feel compelled to go back and watch the old episodes
1. A "stats" page showing what were your favorite seasons of a given year, or your favorite things you watched that year
1. Add a confirmation dialog when removing shows
1. Add a "seen?" checkbox to the seasons list on the show page
