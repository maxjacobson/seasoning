# Seasoning

Playing around with an idea for a website.
This is mostly an excuse to try out vite.

So far I've just built a passwordless signup/signin via magic links.

Deploying to: <http://seasoning.herokuapp.com/> aka <https://www.seasoning.tv>

## Kebabs, snakes, and camels

- Use kebab case in routes
- Use camel case for typescript variables
- Use snake case in ruby variables
- Use snake case in the serialized API data
