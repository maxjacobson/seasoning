# Seasoning

Your couch away from your couch.

Deploying to: <http://seasoning.herokuapp.com/> aka <https://www.seasoning.tv>

Demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aB6LbN2ff8>

## Setup

1. Install ruby, node, and postgres
1. Run `cp .env.development .env.development.local` and fill out `.env.development.local`
1. Run `bin/setup`

Then to start things up:

1. `bin/dev` -- this starts both the Rails server and CSS watcher

And visit <http://localhost:3000>

## Tests

To run the tests locally:

```
npm run build:css
bin/rails test:all
```

Note: The CSS must be built before running tests, as the system tests rely on properly styled elements being visible and interactive.

Aren't I so cool?

Make some more changes to the README.
