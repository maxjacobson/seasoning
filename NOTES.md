# Getting started with Tailwind

Following this guide: <https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite>

## TODO

- [x] Set up Tailwind
  - [x] Tailwind editor integration to get rid of warnings in css files
- [x] Convert emotion styles to Tailwind styles
- [x] Convert inline styles to Tailwind styles
- [x] Remove emotion
- [ ] Make it look nicer using Tailwind
  - [x] Stars on new review page are too small
- [ ] Can we use typescript & es6 modules for our new config files for tailwind and postcss?
  - [ ] do I need to add "type": "module" to package.json?
- [ ] why does it do a full page refresh rather than hot module reloading when changing tailwind classes?
- [ ] try out the official forms plugin: <https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms>
- [ ] Make a button component that is inspired by the thing I copied from the docs:

```
      <input
        type="submit"
        value="Search"
        className="cursor-pointer rounded-full border border-orange-200 px-4 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-orange-600 hover:border-transparent hover:bg-orange-600 hover:text-white focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-orange-600 focus:ring-offset-2"
      />
```
