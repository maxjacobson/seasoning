# Getting started with Tailwind

Following this guide: <https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite>

## TODO

- [x] Set up Tailwind
  - [x] Tailwind editor integration to get rid of warnings in css files
- [x] Convert emotion styles to Tailwind styles
- [ ] Convert inline styles to Tailwind styles
- [x] Remove emotion
- [ ] Make it look nicer using Tailwind
  - [ ] Stars on new review page are too small
- [ ] Can we use typescript & es6 modules for our new config files for tailwind and postcss?
  - [ ] do I need to add "type": "module" to package.json?
- [ ] why does it do a full page refresh rather than hot module reloading when changing tailwind classes?
